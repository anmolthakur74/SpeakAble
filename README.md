# Title: Real-Time Sign Language Recognition (Problem Statement 7)

# Project Name: SpeakAble

**SpeakAble** is an AI-powered real-time communication system designed to bridge the gap between individuals who are deaf, mute, or blind. It combines gesture recognition, speech-to-text, and text-to-speech to enable inclusive, accessible conversations.

---

## Project Objectives

- Recognize hand gestures using computer vision and machine learning
- Convert recognized gestures into text and speech
- Convert spoken audio into text in real-time
- Enable communication between deaf, mute, and blind users

## Features

- Real-time hand gesture recognition (letters, commands like `space`, `del`, `end`)
- Speech-to-text input for blind-to-mute communication
- Text-to-speech output for mute-to-blind interaction
- Stable prediction buffering and autocorrect
- Clean UI with live output overlay
